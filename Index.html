Professional Summary
As a highly accomplished and influential Service Delivery/Technical Product Manager, I specialize in driving
structured digital product delivery and enhancing operational functions within global environments. My extensive
experience allows me to lead multi-disciplinary teams, including Developers and L2/L3 Support, ensuring we
deliver complex outcomes efficiently and effectively.
I provide strategic leadership and structure, which has resulted in significant achievements such as verified cost
reductions (e.g., £58,000 monthly savings) and a 30% revenue increase through premium service models. My
expertise in delivery governance and process improvement ensures that our services consistently meet and
exceed customer expectations.
I thrive on autonomy and initiative, bridging the gap between Product, Design, Engineering, and Client needs. My
certifications in ITIL v4 and deep expertise in Agile frameworks and platform ownership (MS Dynamics 365, MS 365
Azure, and Atlassian suite) enable me to deliver exceptional value to our customers.
Due to recent changes at the Highbourne Group, I am open to new and exciting opportunities and any career
change.
